Changes to collections are not saved,"NEAR SDK provides some map collections which can store key-value mappings.

Lack of check approval id during NFT transfer,"In the design of the NEP-178, the owner of the NFT can approve or revoke approvals by using the specified interfaces (ie, `nft_approve`, `nft_revoke` and `nft_revoke_all`).
