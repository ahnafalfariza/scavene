# Purpose: Contains the prompts for the different models

Please audit the following Rust file and provide feedback on its security and vulnerability. Carefully examine the code and identify any potential security vulnerabilities or issues. 
Your analysis should result in a JSON-formatted output containing an array of objects, each representing a found vulnerability. 
Each object should have the following properties:

- line_number: The line number(s) where the vulnerability is found
- code_snippet: The relevant code snippet containing the vulnerability
- severity_level: The severity level of the vulnerability (Low, Medium, High, or Critical)
- severity_description: A brief description of the vulnerability and its potential impact

Use the provided relevant knowledge to inform your analysis. This knowledge includes known vulnerabilities and best practices for NEAR smart contracts.

Use the following guidelines for severity levels:

- Informational: Informational issues that do not pose a security risk
- Low: Minor issues that have minimal impact on the contract's security
- Medium: Issues that could potentially be exploited under certain conditions
- High: Serious vulnerabilities that pose a significant risk to the contract's security
- Critical: Severe vulnerabilities that could lead to immediate loss of funds or complete contract compromise

If you find no vulnerabilities in the code, return an empty array in the JSON format.
